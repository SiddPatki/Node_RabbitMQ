based on- https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-implement-a-simple-message-queue-in-node-js-ee52e4ad6615


It is used wherever an immediate response in not required.
Message queue have multiple application:
	Live notification to user on a web site without refreshing.
	Posting review of product after processing it through system.

Messaging Queue enables asynchronous communication, where application(producer) puts a message onto a message queue and does not require an immediate response to continuing processing.
The producer and consumer do not interact directly with each other, but they interact through message queue.
This way of handling messages decouples the producer from the consumer so that they do not need to interact with the message queue simultaneously and immediately.
